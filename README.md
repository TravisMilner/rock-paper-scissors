# Game Creation
Created a rock, paper, scissors game where the terminal will decide player choice. Feel free to change the argument in playGame() which is the computer choice

# Test

test.py holds the testing on the outcome of the game based on what is picked. I tested three different scenarios and since the terminal is choosing what the player gets as well the test is full automated.
